## BTI425 Week 10 Notes

So far, we've been working with our web applications in a local environment. We have relied on the frameworks (ie, the integrated "development servers" included in React / Angular) to execute our code on localhost. However, sooner or later we will have to build and publish these applications so that they are available for the public / clients to use.  This week, we will see how we can achieve this using a combination of [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Additionally, throughout our discussion of Angular, we have largely been ignoring the test features that have been made available to us. This week, we will begin to explore how testing works in Angular, and how we can write simple tests using Jasmine.

## BTI425 Week 4 Notes

This week we will continue to work with *props* as a way to communicate data between components, as well as introduce event handling, routing and working with data from an API. 

First, we will discuss how to process / "wire up" events and options for conditionally rendering data in a collection.  We will also briefly discuss how to display content (or not) while we're waiting for data to load.  

Next, we will focus on how we can achieve routing within the browser by leveraging the excellent [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) components.  This will allow uses to quickly navigate to different "views" without leaving the application.

Finally, we will put this all together and make a simple app that uses 3rd party UI components ([react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [react-router-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-bootstrap)) to create a simple UI to view data from the public [reqres testing API](https://reqres.in/).

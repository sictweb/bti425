## BTI425 Week 12 Notes

We have now reached a point in our Angular learning where we can start to play with some of the more interesting tools and libraries. We are familiar with the basics of how to create Components, Services, Routes, Forms with Two-Way Binding, working with JWT and even how to use some of the testing frameworks used by Angular. However, one common tool that is often used in modern applications is still missing from our skill set: Sockets, specifically the "Socket.io" library.

For more information:

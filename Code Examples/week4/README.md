## Week 4 code example

This is the React example for this week.  It features client-side routing using [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) and custom UI components from the following packages:

* [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/): `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
* [react-router-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-bootstrap): `npm install react-router-bootstrap`

For data, it uses [https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/).

Once again, to ensure that this example functions, please remember to run the command while in the directory/folder that has the `package.json` file:

```
npm i
```
